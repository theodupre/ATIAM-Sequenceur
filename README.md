# ATIAM-Sequenceur

Realization of a intelligent pattern sequencer using VAE in the context of the machine learning project at ATIAM Master.

# Getting Started

### Prerequisites
All the project is coded in python 3.7.0. Several libraries will me recommended to be installed : 
music21
sounddevice
torch

## Generate pattern
To genereate new drum pattern, open the Activation_Matrix_To_Sound.py file and execute it. 
A window will appear and click in it to generate a sound. You can click multiple of time.
To finish the run, close this window. 

## Create activation matrices from midi
To create these activation matrices, open the Midi_To_Activation_Matrix.py file and execute it.
The example is done with the midi file HOUSE1.py

## Pattern Datasets
All the midi dataset is in the Dataset_Drum_Groove_Midi folder. 
The corresponding activation matrices are in the Dataset_Drum_Groove_Pattern folder.
